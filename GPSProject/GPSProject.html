<h3>Atoms</h3>




<h3>Electronic Configuration</h3>
<p>Electrons fill up the energy levels, or 'shells' starting on the innermost shell first - the lowest energy level.</p>
<p>Each shell can only contain a certain number of electrons, at GCSE level; </p>
<div style="padding-left: 30px; line-height: 0.25; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><ul><li><p style="padding-left: 0px;">1st shell - 2 electrons</p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 0px;">2nd shell - 8 electrons</p></li><li><p style="padding-left: 0px;">3rd shell - 8 electrons</p></li></ul></div>
<p>So for example, an atom of carbon contains 6 protons - and therefore 6 electrons. Remembering the 1st shell only takes 2 electrons, so the remaining 4 electrons will have to sit in the second shell. So an atom of carbon would look like this: </p>

<p>We can write the electron configuration for Carbon as [2,4]</p>
<p>An atom of Sodium contains 11 electrons, so again the 1st shell takes 2 electrons, the 2nd shell takes 8 electrons, so the remaining electron sits in the third shell as seen: </p>

<p>Similarly, an atom of Calcium contains 20 electrons, so the electron configuration would be [2,8,8,2]. </p>

<h3>Periodic Table</h3>



<p>Atoms prefer to have a full outer shell - like those in Group 0 - noble gases e.g. Argon [2,8,8]. When atoms do not have a full outer shell, it makes them want to react so that they can achieve a full outer shell. The number of atoms in the outermost shell will decide whether the atom will prefer to lose electrons to achieve a full outer shell, or gain electrons to achieve a full outer shell. </p><p>For example, Potassium [2,8,8,1] has 1 electron in its out shell. It is much easier for potassium to lose 1 electron and become [2,8,8]<sup>+</sup> than it is for potassium to gain 7 electrons to become [2,8,8,8]. Therefore potassium will lose an electron to achieve a full outer shell. </p><p>Chlorine [2,8,7] would find it much easier to gain 1 electron than lose 7, so chlorine is likely to react to become [2,8,8].</p>

<p>So why are some elements more reactive than others? </p>
<p>One reason, is that for example, oxygen [2,6] needs to gain 2 electrons to achieve a full outer shell, while chlorine [2,8,7] only needs to gain 1 electron to achieve its full outer shell. This means Chlorine is more likely to achieve its full outer shell first, and is therefore more reactive.</p>
<h3>Ions</h3>
<p>When an atom gains, or loses an electron, an ion is formed.</p>
<p>For example, when Chlorine gains an electron and achieves a full outer shell, it has 17 protons in the nucleus (as before) but now has 18 electrons. This means it has a positive charge of +17 and a negative charge of -18. 17-18 = -1. So the overall charge of this new atom of chlorine is -1. We call this a negative ion, this one in particular is [2,8,8]<sup>-</sup> or Cl<sup>-</sup></p>
<p>Similarly, if Calcium [2,8,8,2] lost 2 of its electrons, it would have 20 protons and 18 electrons. This means it would have an overall charge of +20-18 = +2, so would be [2,8,8]<sup>2+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup></p>
